    <li><h4>Gameplay</h4></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Player is spawned in the desert with 5 different rooms. The first room is the spawn room where players can get familiar with controls and relax. </li>
        <li>Player then can approach the 2nd room and the player can automatically spawn monsters if they get close to the palm tree near the entrance. </li>   
        <li>3 monsters will spawn and players should stay within the room and kill the monsters by shooting them. A shooting sound will play when the player shoots, and when the player hits the monster. If a monster physically touches the player, the player’s health will take a hit and start to go down. The monster will die and disappear once their health reaches 0. As the player progresses in each room, the monster’s health will increase and be harder. </li>
        <li>This will continue for 2 more rooms where monsters will spawn when the player gets close to the palm tree. Monsters will have more health compared to the previous rooms. Note: players should stay in the room where the monsters are spawned or else they will not take damage. </li>
        <li>The last room is the boss room. Before approaching the boss room palm tree, there is a potion god to the right. Interact with the potion god with the interact button for him to release the potion. Then players can run over the potion and heal themselves back to max health. Then the player can approach the palm tree and spawn the boss. The boss has even more health and players can shoot them in the legs while maintaining distance from the boss. Once the boss dies, the game is over and a time will be displayed of how long the player took to beat the game. </li>
        <li>If the player dies before completing the game. The player has to quit the game and re-run the game. </li>
